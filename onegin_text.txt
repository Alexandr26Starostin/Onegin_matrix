I'm the most honest rules,1
When you are not joking,2
He respected himself.3
It'd better not to come up with.4
an example of other science;5
But, my God, what a bore.6
sit with the sick and day and night,7
Don't go a step away!8
What a low insidiousness9
To be amusing,10
He's got his pillows right,11
It's sad to bring the medicine,12
To breathe and think about yourself:13
When the hell will take you!14
